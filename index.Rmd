# Preamble

This is the course notes for an *Intermediate R Workshop* run by David Wilkinson. 

This material has been adapted with permission from Research Platforms Services's own [*Introductory R Workshop*](https://nikkirubinstein.gitbooks.io/resguides-introductory-r-workshop/content/) course material.

# Technical Requirements

All attendees will be required to **bring their own laptop and charger**. Tablets and/or Chromebooks (or similar) are not recommended. It can have a Windows, Mac, or Linux operating system, but you must have administrative privileges.

Attendees are also asked to install both [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) and [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/) in advance of the workshop. Both **R** and **RStudio** are updated regularly with both new features and bug fixes, so we require attendees to have **R** v3.6 or later, and **RStudio** v1.2 or later.
